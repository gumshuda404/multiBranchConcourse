# MultiBranchConcourse

- This is a Personal Project which I am working on to automate the creation of Pipelines of new branches created and similarly delete pipelines when a branch is merged or deletedusing concourse ci. 
- I used Concourse quick start from the concourse documentation and fly cli to run/stop/pause pipelines.
- This is a work on progress project. 

## Requirements

- wsl 2 - preffered ubuntu

- Fly cli from concourse ci ui.
